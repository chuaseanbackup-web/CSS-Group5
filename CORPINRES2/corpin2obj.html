<h1>Objectives</h1>
<hr>
<p>
1. To determine how low-cost imaging tools can help detect and quantify Xanthomonas campestris infection in okra.<br>
2. To evaluate the accuracy of image-based tools compared to traditional visual assessments.<br>
3. To assess the effectiveness of spatiotemporal mapping in showing the progression of infection over time.<br>
4. To determine if image-based methods provide earlier detection of the disease than conventional methods.<br>
5. To evaluate the feasibility of a low-cost image-based mapping system for disease monitoring in resource-limited settings.
