<h1> Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
To evaluate the waste-sorting device's effectiveness in identifying non-biodegradable
waste, we will conduct a controlled experiment. A series of non-biodegradable waste will be set
up to feed a variety of plastic items, aluminum cans, PET bottles, and tetra packs into the
device's field of view. The Arduino-programmed camera will be positioned above the trash bins.
The captured images will be processed by the Arduino using image processing techniques
to identify key features such as color, shape, and texture. Specifically, the device will be trained
to recognize the unique characteristics of plastics, aluminum, PET, and tetra pack materials. <br><br>
Once identified, the device will sort the waste into appropriate categories based on these material
types.
To assess the accuracy of the sorting process, the sorted waste will be manually inspected
and compared to the ground truth labels. Standards such as precision will be used to evaluate the
device's ability to correctly identify and categorize the different types of non-biodegradable
waste. Additionally, the time taken by the device to process each image and make a sorting
decision will be measured to determine its efficiency.<br><br>
To further optimize the device's performance, we will refine the image processing
algorithms to improve accuracy and speed. Techniques such as feature extraction, machine
learning, and deep learning may be explored to enhance the device's ability to distinguish
between different types of non-biodegradable waste. Hardware modifications, such as upgrading
the camera and lighting system, may also be considered to improve image quality and capture
more detailed information about the waste items.</p>
