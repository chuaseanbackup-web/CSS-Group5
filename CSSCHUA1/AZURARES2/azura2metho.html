<hr>
<p>MATERIALS THAT WILL BE USED:<br>
The following materials will be used in the experiment:<br>
1.	Lanzones peels<br>
2.	Blender<br>
3.	Distilled water<br>
4.	Spray bottle<br>
5.	Sliced bread<br>
6.	Clear containers<br>
7.	Gloves and mask<br>
<br><br>
PROCEDURE<br>
1.10 Lanzones peels will be dried under the sun for a day.<br>
2. The dried peels will be blended into small pieces.<br>
3. About 100 ml of distilled water will be added to the peels and left to soak for 48 hours.<br>
4. The extract will then be filtered using a strainer.<br>
5. The liquid extract will be transferred into a spray bottle.<br>
6. The liquid extract will be sprayed  about 10cm away from the bread<br>
7. Bread slices will be divided into two groups: one will be sprayed with the extract, and the other will not be sprayed. This experimentation will consider the amount of sprayed product onto the bread.
