This skin is characterized by its light greyish-yellow to pale brownish or pink color and a velvety texture. It can be leathery, thin, or thick, and is notable for containing milky latex (Orwa et al., 2009). Once a person consumes the flesh, they throw away the peels and this is a huge problem because this adds additional waste. To lessen this problem scientist did some experimentation and found out that the peels contains antifungals like for example, polyphenols and tannins base on science, these chemicals can delay mold. But to strengthen our knowledge, mold is a very common problem. When we go to grocery stores and buy bread, its either a “consume before 3-4 days “ since it will get moldy. So bakeries use chemicals preservatives, but the use of conventional chemical preservatives has several drawbacks, necessitating the development of clean-label alternatives. (Claudia Axel, et.al., 2017) so, some people avoid these and prefer natural preservatives for bread.
