<hr>
<p>(1) What are the measured flow characteristics such as velocity, depth, and
discharge of selected sections of the Marikina River?<br>
(2) What is the population density of janitor fish across the sampling stations ?<br>
(3) How does the spatial distribution of janitor fish vary with changes in water
flow dynamics? <br>
( 4) Is there a statistically significant relationship between flow parameters and
janitor fish density?<br>
(5 ) Which flow conditions are most closely associated with changes in fish
concentration?
