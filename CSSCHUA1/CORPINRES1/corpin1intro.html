<h1> Introduction </h1>
<hr>
<p>Rivers operate as dynamic physical systems shaped by continuous changes in flow
velocity, discharge, and depth. These physical conditions influence how aquatic
organisms occupy certain habitats, as flow regulates substrate movement, food
availability, and refuge stability (Chow, 1994). In the Philippines, the Marikina River
exhibits noticeable fluctuations in water movement due to seasonal rainfall and
watershed runoff, which significantly modify its hydraulic characteristics throughout
the year (DENR, 2020). Such changes directly affe ct organisms living within the river,
particularly invasive species th at thrive in stable or slow-flowing env ironments.

<br><br>
	One example is the janitor fish (Pterygoplichthys spp.), an invasive armored catfish
known to proliferate in Philippine ri vers. Reports from the B ureau of Fisheries and
Aquatic Resources (BFAR, 2019) indicate that these fish prefer d eeper, slow ermoving waters where physical stress is minimal. Local assess ments of the Marikina
River further show that s table hydrological conditions create favorable environment s
for the s pecies to concentrate an d reproduce (Marikina River Rehabilitation Report,
2021). Since water movement controls habitat suitability, the dis tribution of ja ni tor
fish is e xpected to show patterns inf luenced by the river’s physical flow conditions.
<br><br>
  Given these factors, this study investigates how measurable hydrological variab les
such as flow velocity, depth, and discharge relate to the density and spatial
distribut ion of janitor fish along selected sections of the Marikina Rive r. By analyzing
these ph y sical properties, the research applies a physical science perspective to
identify which river zones are most associated with high fish concentration. The
findings aim not only to describe distribution patterns but also to provide scientific
evidence that ma y su pport future river manage ment strategies.
