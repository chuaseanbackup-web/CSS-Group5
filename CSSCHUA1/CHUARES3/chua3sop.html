<h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
<hr>
<p>
To address the existing knowledge gap, this study aims to determine the surface flow velocity, transport behavior, and accumulation probability of plastic debris in the Marikina River during flood events using Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV). By analyzing flood video data and river surface motion, the study estimates current plastic accumulation levels and identify high-risk accumulation zones across selected barangays in Marikina City. The study also examines whether the results produced by the LSPIV-based model are validated using established hydrodynamic and debris transport equations.
