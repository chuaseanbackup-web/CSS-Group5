<p>
This study focuses and aims to evaluate the bioactive compounds of Rhizophora stylosa and find out its antibacterial potential against common bacterias, specifically the bacteria, Staphylococcus Aureus. The objective of this study is to know the biochemicals of Rhizophora stylosa with antibacterial properties, specifically for bacterias such as Staphylococcus Aureus. The general question that is going to be assessed in this study is if Rhizophora stylosa in its biochemicals has antibacterial properties. This study will use a quantitative-experimental design. The plant was dried, crushed, and extracted using 70% ethanol. The extract was placed into wells on agar plates inoculated with S. aureus. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 48–72 hours. Zones of inhibition were measured to assess antibacterial activity.
