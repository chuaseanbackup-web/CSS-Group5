<p>This study aims to determine the nesting patterns, spatial distribution, and density of janitor fish along the Marikina River using morphological operations on digital images. Specifically, it seeks to determine if nests are clustered in areas with stable current flow, examine the effect of river current intensity on nesting patterns, and validate morphological operations as a reliable tool for monitoring and mapping janitor fish nesting sites for effective river management and conservation planning.
