<h1> Introduction </h1>
<hr>
<p>The lack of well-established predictive models tailored to the Marikina River in the Philippines makes it challenging to quantify the transport of plastic debris in urban river systems. Due to the rapid mobilization and redistribution of plastic waste during flood events, this knowledge gap poses significant risks to public safety and the environment. Unmanaged plastic waste can impede drainage systems, exacerbate the effects of flooding, and endanger aquatic ecosystems because Marikina City is highly susceptible to typhoons and flooding. Therefore, creating efficient waste management and flood mitigation plans requires accurate forecasting of debris escape and accumulation.

	In order to forecast the movement of plastic debris during flood conditions, the study uses a geometry-driven mathematical model that examines the topology of the Marikina River.
    River slope, channel width, curvature, connecting branches are important geometric factors that
   affect debris transport and flow velocity. Debris input, retention, transport, and escape across various river segments are taken into account by model components. The findings pinpoint high-risk escape routes and topographically controlled accumulation zones during peak discharge events. This study supports sustainable river management in Marikina City and lays the groundwork for focused cleanup initiatives.The Marikina River has long been affected by environmental challenges, and one of its most persistent issues is the rapid spread of the invasive janitor fish. Originally introduced in the Philippines through the aquarium trade, these fish escaped into natural waterways and have since multiplied quickly, becoming a major ecological concern (Stiefel, 2023). Their presence disrupts the river’s natural balance. They compete with native species for food, disturb benthic habitats, and weaken riverbanks through their burrowing and nesting behavior. Because of their hardy nature and ability to survive in poor water conditions, janitor fish thrive easily in the Marikina River, making population control difficult (Herrera, 2020). In recent years, their growing population has also been linked to changes in river sedimentation patterns and declining numbers of certain native fish species. Local communities have reported increased riverbank collapse in areas with high janitor fish activity, indicating that the issue affects not only the ecosystem but also human settlements (Espiritu, 2023).  Janitor fish reproduce by creating burrow-type nests along soft, silty riverbanks. Males dig and guard these burrows, protecting the eggs until they hatch. This nesting behavior not only accelerates their population growth but also contributes to erosion, as repeated burrowing destabilizes soil along the river’s edge (Federico, et al., 2021). 
Recent studies have shown that digital images and morphological operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing are very useful for studying janitor fish nests. These methods help to separate the nests from the surrounding riverbank, remove small unwanted details or noise, and clearly show the true shape and size of each burrow. By using these tools, researchers can accurately outline nest boundaries, measure the area of each nest, and see how the nests are spread along the riverbanks. Morphological operations make it easier to study the nests in detail, providing more precise information than simply looking at the river by eye. This information is important because it helps scientists and local authorities identify areas that are most affected, plan ways to protect the riverbanks, and develop strategies to control the spread of janitor fish. Overall, combining image analysis with mathematical morphology gives a clearer, more organized way to monitor nests and better understand their impact on the river ecosystem. (Ramdhan, 2020)
Understanding what influences their choice of nesting sites is therefore essential for managing their impact. Studying the janitor fish nesting behavior using morphological operations is crucial for protecting native species, and ensuring the long-term stability of the Marikina River ecosystem.
