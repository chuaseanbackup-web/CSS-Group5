<h1> Methodology </h1>
<hr>
<p>Waste management is one of the most common problems in the world, this is caused by increasing urbanization and industrialization (Lama, 2024). Furthermore, some countries like India are struggling with the problem because of the increasing population and the shortage of budget (Sunil ET AL, 2020). Some researchers like Nagayo and others (2019), and Sanjay and Sanju (2020) decided to create a robot that can segregate waste products using different types of sensors like moisture sensor and ultrasonic sensor. One of the most essential components in developing an intelligent waste-collecting robot is its camera sensor and image processing techniques, which allow it to detect, classify, and collect different types of waste products accurately. However, the robots that those researchers created can only detect waste products based on its characteristics like moisture.

	The researcher will be going to fill the gap of the problem by utilizing camera sensor with its camera-image processing techniques, along with ultrasonic sensor to not only improve the existing design, but also contribute to the field by sharing the results of the researchers experimentation. And to contribute to the waste management problem.This study aims to evaluate the performance of a robot equipped with a camera sensor and image processing system in detecting and collecting different types of waste products across various locations. Specifically, it seeks to determine the robot’s accuracy, speed, and maximum reach in detecting waste, as well as the maximum amount of waste it can collect under varying environmental and physical conditions. The results of this research may contribute to the development of more efficient and adaptive robotic waste management systems that can operate effectively in real-world settings.
