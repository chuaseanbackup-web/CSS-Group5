<h1> Introduction </h1>
<hr>
<p>
The world is producing more and more waste, and much of it is not being recycled
properly. Traditional methods of sorting waste by hand are slow, inaccurate, and can lead to
contamination of recyclable materials. This research aims to develop a device that can
automatically sort waste, specifically focusing on non-biodegradable items. By using a camera
and an Arduino board, the device will be able to accurately identify different types of
non-biodegradable waste, such as plastic, PET bottles, cans, and Tetra Packs. This will help to
improve recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.</p>
