<h1> Introduction </h1>

The global drive for renewable energy stems from concerns about fossil fuel depletion, environmental degradation, and climate change. Bioethanol is a promising renewable fuel due to its biodegradability and ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, using food crops like corn and sugarcane for production raises ethical and economic issues, especially in developing countries where food security is a concern.
Agricultural and fruit wastes offer a sustainable, low-cost alternative feedstock for bioethanol production. The Philippines, a tropical country, generates substantial fruit residues, particularly from pineapple (Ananas comosus) and banana (Musa acuminata). These industries produce large amounts of discarded peels and cores, contributing to environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and increased waste management costs.
Pineapple wastes are rich in fermentable sugars, while banana peels contain starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose, making both suitable for ethanol fermentation. While individual studies exist, limited research explores their combined use as dual substrates. A co-fermentation approach could enhance ethanol yield by balancing nutrient composition and maximizing waste valorization.
This study aims to establish the feasibility of producing bioethanol from Ananas comosus and Musa acuminata wastes as dual feedstocks by optimizing the substrate ratio and fermentation conditions. This contributes to renewable energy development, sustainable waste management, and circular economy practices in the Philippine context.
