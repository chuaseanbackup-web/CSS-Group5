<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
This study uses drone-based observations, LSPIV analysis, and river data to investigate plastic debris accumulation in the Marikina River during flood events. A high-resolution drone will be used to capture videos and images of the river surface, focusing on areas frequently affected by flooding. These videos will provide visual data on floating plastics, flow patterns, and river surface dynamics. The drone data will be supplemented with existing river measurements, including channel width, slope, curvature, and floodplain connectivity.
<br><br>
The video data will be processed using Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) to calculate surface flow velocity, direction, and turbulence, which are indicators of how plastic debris moves along the river. LSPIV analysis will also identify slow-moving zones and eddies where plastics are likely to accumulate. The combined dataset from drone observations, river measurements, and LSPIV output will be organized and analyzed using statistical software to assess patterns and relationships between flow characteristics and plastic accumulation.
<br><br>
To quantify these relationships, Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be applied. This will determine how strongly factors like river slope, curvature, and flow velocity influence debris accumulation. Results will be visualized through tables, graphs, and spatial maps, highlighting high-risk accumulation zones.
