<h1> Research Objective </h1>
<hr>
<p>1 . Measure flow velocity, depth, and compute discharge at nine sampling
stations.<br>2. Quantify janitor fish density (fish/m²) using standardized netting and
visual transects.<br>3. Compare fish density across upstream, midstream, and downstream zones.<br>4. Test statistical relationships between flow variables an d fish density.<br>5. Identify statistically significant hotspots ( highest-density stations )
