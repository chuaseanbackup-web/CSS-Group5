<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
During the study there is a process in which it involves a report in which it contains the analysis of the study. Both image-analysis methods in this study accurately separated diseased areas from healthy plant tissue and, at 4, 6, and 9 days after inoculation, both were able to show measurable differences in symptoms among the treatments.

This means either method can be used to quantify disease severity, though each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Because reliable measurement of disease severity is essential in plant–pathogen research, a variety of techniques are commonly used, such as visual scoring, monitoring pathogen growth inside the plant, and assays that detect defense responses. Image-based phenotyping approaches have also been developed, each offering unique benefits and limitations that should be evaluated when selecting a method and interpreting results
