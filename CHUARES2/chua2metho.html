<h1> Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>The research will be conducted in selected river sections representing varying current intensity and flow conditions. High-resolution images of the Marikina River will be captured using a waterproof camera to ensure clear documentation of burrows and nest structures even near the waterline. Each photograph will be taken at predetermined coordinates to maintain consistency in sampling across various flow conditions. All images will be processed using a Java-based program. The images will first be converted into monochrome and then into binary format, where nest areas are represented as foreground pixels (0) and non-nest areas as background pixels (1). Morphological operations will then be applied to these binary images. Opening (erosion followed by dilation) will be used first to remove noise and eliminate small unwanted elements that may interfere with analysis. Next, closing (dilation followed by erosion) will be applied to fill small gaps, smooth the nest edges, and produce clearer and more accurate nest shapes. These cleaned binary images will allow for precise detection of nest structures. After processing, all identified nest shapes and their coordinates will be plotted on a graph that includes information on current flow and intensity for each site. Spatial analysis will be conducted to identify common points, clustering tendencies, and recurring patterns across different river conditions. Statistical tests or descriptive comparison will be used to determine whether current intensity influences nest concentration. This ensures accurate detection of nest structures and a reliable examination of how current flow influences nesting patterns along the Marikina River.
