<h1> Statement of the Problem </h1>
<hr>
<p>This study aims to determine the nesting patterns of janitor fish (Pterygoplichthys spp.) using Morphological Operations along the Marikina River. Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions: <br><br>
• What is the estimated concentration of janitor fish nests along different sections of the Marikina River based on the digital image?<br><br>

• Are janitor fish nests clustered in areas with stable current flow according to morphological analysis?
<br><br>
• How does river current intensity influence the nesting patterns of janitor fish as detected through morphological operations?
