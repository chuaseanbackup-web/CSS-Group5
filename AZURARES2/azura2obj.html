<p>By making use of something we usually throw and discard away, we can turn waste into something helpful like for example, using lanzones peels are a mold delay agent in bread storage. This shows that small changes in how we see things can create big benefits for both people and the planet. Lanzones peels may seem simple, but they can play an important role in protecting food and reducing waste. </p>
