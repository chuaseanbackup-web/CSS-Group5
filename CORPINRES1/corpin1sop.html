    <h1> Statement of the Problem </h1>
<hr>
<p>(1) What are the measured flow characteristics such as velocity, depth, and
discharge of selected sections of the Marikina River?<br>
(2) What is the population density of janitor fish across the sampling stations ?<br>
(3) How does the spatial distribution of janitor fish vary with changes in water
flow dynamics? <br>
( 4) Is there a statistically significant relationship between flow parameters and
janitor fish density?<br>
(5 ) Which flow conditions are most closely associated with changes in fish
concentration?
</p>

<h1> Hypotheses </h1>
<hr>
Ho1:There is no significant variation in the measured flow characteristics
(velocity, discharge, and dept h) a m ong the selected sections of t he Marikina
River.<br>
Ha1:There is a significant variation in the measured flow characteristics
(velocity, discharge, and depth) among the selected sections of the Marikina
River.<br>
Ho2:There is no significant d ifference in janitor fish density across the nine
sampling stations along the river.<br>
Ha2:There is a significant difference in janitor fish density across the nine
sampling stations along the river.<br>
Ho3?:Water flow dynamics (velocity, discharge, depth) do not significantly
influence the spatial distributionn of janitor fish.<br>
Ha3:Water flow dynamics (velocity, discharge, depth) significantly influence
the spatial distribution of janitor fish.<br>
Ho4:There is no statistically significant relationship between water flow
parameters and janitor fish density.<br>
Ha4:There is a statistically significant relationship between water flow
parameters and janitor fish density.<br>
H o5:Different flow conditions (slow/laminar, moderat e, fast/turbulent) do not
significantly affect the increase o r decrease in janitor fish concentration.<br>
Ha5:Different flow conditions (slow/laminar, moderate, fa st/turbulent)
significantly affect the increase or decrease in janitor fish concentration.
